        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project consists of exploring a conversation system and simulating NPC routines in a Third Person Game</p>

        <h2>Initital Objectives of the Prototype</h2>
        
            <li>  Create a system that allows to make branching dialogue,
    letting the player decide the direction of a conversation.</li>
            <li>  Make a system that controls the pass of time, 
    triggered by certain events (By interacting with the house as seen in the prototype)</li>
            <li>Give the NPC schedules depending on the time of day.</li>

        <h2>Results and Observations</h2>
    <li> After the time assigned to completing this prototype,
    all the initial objectives were met.</li>
    <li>  The first system tackled was the calendar system for passing time. 
    It led me to create Item structures to allow the player to interact and trigger the events
    for advancing time of day.</li>
    <li>  When making the NPC schedules it was necessary to 
    set up locations where NPCs would go.</li>
    <li>  In addition to all the initial objectives, 
    I went ahead to create a very simple weight based inventory system. 
    Since items were done through the development of the prototype it was very simple to implement.</li>
