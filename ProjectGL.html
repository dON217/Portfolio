        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>    This project consists of a simple level to better understand how the engine handles 2D games,
    in combination of a 3D world. Also exploring the ability to create a climbing system
    and an early iteration of questing.</p>

        <h2>Initital Objectives of the Prototype</h2>
        
            <li>  Create and set up a 2D character 
            with basic locomotion and animations for each of them.</li>
            <li>  Explore how to make a climbing system, 
            aiming to use different climbable objects. </li>
            <li> Design a simple quest system
             to work with different kinds of objectives.</li>

    <section id="observations">
        <h2>Results and Observations</h2>
    <li> Unreal Engine now incorporates all the tools needed to implement 2D assets and characters.</li>
    <li> The climbing system turned out to be working well, 
    using different types of climbable surfaces.</li>
    <li> A simple quest system was implemented allowing multiple quest types. 
    Recursion was key to carry out the goals of the system. Iterate, and experiment with other methods 
    to find better modularity.</li>
